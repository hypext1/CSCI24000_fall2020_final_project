How to play "Blood Alchemy":

-Each player starts with a deck of 12 cards.

-At the start of the game, each player draws 4 cards.

-Type the letter of the card you want to play (example: "b")

-Type which column you want it to go to (example: "2")

-Placing a card costs life.

-Placing a card in an empty column does damage to the other player!

-Placing a card in a column with another monster makes the two monsters fight!

-Cards can be placed on top of each other to do damage in that column again!

-First player to hit 0 health loses the game.

Cards:

b (cost: -3, power: 4)

d (cost: -2, power: 3)

' (cost: 0, power: 1)

h (cost: +1)

w (cost: -2, destroy all creatures in a column)
