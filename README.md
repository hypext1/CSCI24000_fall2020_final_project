How to play "Blood Alchemy":

Each player starts with a deck of 12 cards.
At the start of the game, each player draws 4 cards.
Type the letter of the card you want to play (example: "b")
Type which column you want it to go to (example: "2")
Placing a card costs life.
Placing a card in an empty column does damage to the other player!
Placing a card in a column with another monster makes the two monsters fight!
First player to hit 0 health loses the game.
