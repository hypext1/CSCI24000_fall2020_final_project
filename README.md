How to play "Blood Alchemy":

-Each player starts with a deck of 12 cards.
-At the start of the game, each player draws 4 cards.
-Type the letter of the card you want to play (example: "b")
-Type which column you want it to go to (example: "2")
-Placing a card costs life.
-Placing a card in an empty column does damage to the other player!
-Placing a card in a column with another monster makes the two monsters fight!
-Cards can be placed on top of each other to do damage in that column again!
-First player to hit 0 health loses the game.
